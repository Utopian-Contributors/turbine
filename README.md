# Turbine

A platform for building sustainable websites and reducing redundant code.

Turbine is a platform for developers who are interested in building sustainable, high-performing websites. It allows searching for a dependency or integrating it into the Turbine browser extension. Projects will be able to configure common dependencies and redundant code to be loaded from the storage of the browser extension during runtime. In the future this platform can be used by developers to create their own special-use browser extensions for their own purposes in order to deliver sustainable, high-performing websites.
